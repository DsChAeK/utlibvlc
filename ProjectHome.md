Class to handle one or more VLC instances in delphi easily.

I did this because all other delphi wrappers I found were out-of-date and not really
useful for my needs.

The Wrapper will be used in [dboxTV](http://www.dschaek.de/).

I used some code from the [TheUnknownOnes](http://code.google.com/p/theunknownones/), thx for your work.
